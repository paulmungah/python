# What is a variable:Variables they are labels which act as containers to hold values. In python,a variable is always associated with some values.
# We use the assignment operator(=) to assign values to a variable.
# Anything that is inside a quote in python is a string
message="Hello there!Hope everything is fine?"
# message2='My auntie sai: "Come here!"'
print(message)


message2="Good Bye!"
print(message2)


# concatenating variables (Joining two or more outputs together)
message3=message + message2
print(message3)

# variable can be named using a letter, number and an underscore. They can start with a letter and an underscore but not a number
_name1="Paul"
print(_name1)

# variables names cannot contain spaces.We can use the underscore to separate the names.
total_marks=85
print(total_marks)

# variable names are not supposed to be keyboard/ reerved characters in python
