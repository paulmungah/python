# create a python program that is able to calculate the simple interest given the principle as 50000, rate as 5% and time as 8 years . SI =(p *R *t)/100
p= 50000
R= 5
t= 8
simpleinterest=  (p * R * t)/100
print("The SI is:", simpleinterest)



# Assignment
# 1. Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75 meters. BMI = (weight) / (height squared)
# 2. Find the Area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm
# Research on python list, tuple and Dictionary Data types.

weight= 78
height= 1.75
BMI=(weight)/(height**2)
print("The BMI is :",BMI)

length=48
width=25
Area=length*width
print("The area is :",Area)
